# Websocket_buttons
ESP 32 WebSocket Server: Control Outputs (Arduino IDE) A lesson from Ruki and Sarah. A link to the original project. https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-websocket-server-arduino/ I just tried adding some buttons and converted it to SPIFFS. Added the ability to update via OTA. Any suggestions are welcome.

To update via OTA, you need to add update to your address in your browser. For example http://192.168.1.1/update
