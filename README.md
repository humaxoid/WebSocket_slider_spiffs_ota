# Websocket_buttons
ESP 32 WebSocket Server: Control Outputs (Arduino IDE) A lesson from Rui and Sara. A link to the original project. https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-websocket-server-arduino/ I just tried adding some buttons and converted it to SPIFFS. Added the ability to update via OTA. Any suggestions are welcome.
